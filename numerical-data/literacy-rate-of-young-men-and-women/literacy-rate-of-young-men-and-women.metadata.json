UNESCO tracks this across different generations – including youth, adults, and older people – to show how literacy is changing over time.",

But it doesn’t tell us whether they can use reading and writing in everyday life, like filling out a job application or reading health instructions. Those kinds of skills take more years of schooling and are much harder to measure, especially when comparing across countries and over time."
