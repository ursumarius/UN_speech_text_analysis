        "Access to electricity improves people's living conditions in many ways. [Light at night](https://ourworldindata.org/light-at-night) makes it possible to get together after sunset; mobile phones allow us to stay in touch with those far away; refrigeration reduces food waste; and household appliances free up time from chores.",

        "It shows that, especially in several African countries, a large share of the population lacks the benefits of basic electricity.",

Where data is missing, values are estimated by the source using a model based on trends across countries, regions, and time. Countries classified as “developed” by the United Nations are assumed to have universal access.",
